    <!-- 1. Build a nice box (div) with some content (e.g. "I'm a box!"), padding, a
    border (style it as you want) and some margin. 2. If you didn't do it
    already: Set different padding and margin for the four different sides of
    the box. 3. Add the same box below the first box and note if you can
    identify any strange behavior. 4. Give the first box a height of 100% of the
    window height. 5. Set the first box back to a more reasonable height of
    300px and set its width to 50%. 6. Position the two boxes next to each
    other. 7. "Hide" box number 1 and see how that changes the page. 8. Add a
    hover effect to the the LAST div element. Use pseudo-classes for that. -->
